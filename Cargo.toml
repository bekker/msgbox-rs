description = """
Simple, cross-platform message box GUI library.
All it does is to show a message box modal with a OK button, which runs synchronously.
All the other jobs stop until the user responds. It runs fine with OpenGL windows already open.
It supports multi-platform, and maintains separate dependencies per platform, thus light-weight.

 - Synchronous Message Modal
 - Multi-platform (Linux GTK3+, Windows and OSX)
 - Light-weight
